Add code to make this run continually. - Potentially just with a 'while True' block but look at the discord bot code
let the tweet reader add the scores it finds into the 'fixture_list'
    the idea is that this will collect all the reported scores for each fixture
    and those can be processed to see which is the most appropriate to publish
add in functionality to reformat a list in the format [[Home, score, away],[Home, score, away]] which
    will be used in the flask functionality
add in the flask functionality to push the above to index.html
find somewhere to host this so that it can be live



others?
do i need to look at how to constantly monitor tweet accounts? twitterReader probably needs a refactor so that it's
not building the list/dictionary in the same function that reads tweets
